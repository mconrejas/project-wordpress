A dashboard to-do list widget with the option to show the to-do list on the website. This is a great tool for web developers building a new website.

== Description ==
Are you a web designer or developer? Or are you creating a plugin or a theme? Are you finding hard to keep track of your tasks or your notepad is just untidy?

Add this useful tool to your WordPress website and create a to-do list from within the main Admin Dashboard. Keep your list in one place and specific to your website/project.

The plugin also gives you the option to display the to-do list as a floating widget on the frontend of your website. If your website is live and viewable by anyone, don't worry, the to-do list is only visible to logged in Administrators.

Simply install and activate the plugin, open your Admin Dashboard and write your list. You can enable its visibility on the website using the checkbox.

== Installation ==
= Via WordPress =
1. From the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New
2. Search for 'Dashboard To-Do List' and click Install. Then click Activate.
3. Go to the WordPress Dashboard to create your to-do list.

= Manual =
1. Upload the folder /dashboard-to-do-list/ to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the WordPress Dashboard to create your to-do list.
